This dir is the drop location for the xmls that are going to be parsed.

A scrubbed version of the file will be pushed here as well if that is toggled on.
The original xml will be moved to the "old" directory.

The first scrubbing run can take time depending on the size of the xml.
Running again on the scrubbed file has no impact on run time or complied information.
